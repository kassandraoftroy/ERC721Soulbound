# ERC721Soulbound

Here is a simple ERC721 extension for nfts that want to forever be tied to a base nft collection. For example, maybe you want to give non-fungible rights or some auxiliary NFT (e.g. an in-game item) to a specific CryptoPunk or ENS domain, in such a way that the owner of said CryptoPunk or ENS name will always be able to assert/take ownership of the asset.

Thus, soulbound. [Inspired by Vitalik's blogpost](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html)

The IERC721Soulbound interface extends IERC721 with a few new methods:

```
    function soul() external view returns (address);

    function boundTo(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256);
 
    function soulOwner(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);

    function reclaim(address claimant, uint256 tokenId) external;

    function canReclaim(address claimant, uint256 tokenId) external view returns (bool);
```

`soul()` Address of the 'soul' ERC721 collection.

`boundTo(uint256 tokenId)` The tokenId of the soul collection that this token is bound to.

`soulOwner(uint256 tokenId)` The rightful owner of the token which may differ from `ownerOf(tokenId)`. The soulOwner can reclaim the token if they are not currently the holder.

`reclaim(address claimant, uint256 tokenId)` Reclaim tokenId to the soulOwner.

`canReclaim(address claimant, uint256 tokenId)` Check if an address can reclaim a token.
